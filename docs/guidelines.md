## **What’s Happening?**
Design, build, and launch **real AI-powered solutions**.

No endless planning. No “perfect specs.” Just **pure creativity \+ AI magic**.

## **The Rules**

* **Build & Deploy** a working **web app**
* Must use at least one AI tool – you’ll need to sign up for a free **OpenRouter API key** (*Some models have free tiers — stick to those during the hackathon*) to integrate AI into your project.  
* Add a nice AI Generated PPT
* Record a **5-min demo video** showing:  
  1. What you built  
  2. How AI helped  
  3. Why it matters  
* Share your **project link** so others can try it

## **🛠️ AI Tools You Can Use**

Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Lovable, n8n, Midjourney, DALL·E, Replit Agents, V0.dev, Bolt.new, Perplexity, Runway ML, ElevenLabs… basically **anything AI-related that helps you build faster**.

## **🏆 How We’ll Judge**

We’ll use a **two-stage process**

### **Stage 1 – Initial Evaluation**
 
* **Criteria:**  
  * **Functionality** – The project works as intended, core features run without major issues.  
  * **UI / UX Quality** – Easy to navigate, visually clean, and intuitive to use.  
  * **Live Deployment** - Project should be live for everyone to use/see so it would be easier to review and vote.
  * **Clarity of Video Explanation** – A 5-min max video that clearly explains the problem, solution, AI role, and shows the product in action.

  ### **Stage 2 – Finalist Deep Dive**

* **Criteria & Weights:**

  * **Documentation & Testing** – Clear product \+ technical docs, setup/run instructions, API/env notes, and relevant tests.   
  * **Overall Execution** – Feels complete, stable, and ready for real use.
