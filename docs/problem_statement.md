# Problem Statement (problem_statement.md)

The current engineer-to-project matching process is managed through spreadsheets, which are hard to
scale, messy, and lack automation. Managers find it difficult to quickly filter engineers by skills,
availability, and geo-location. Similarly, employees lack a structured way to maintain their profile
data and project assignments.

This product solves the problem by:

- Providing a structured platform to manage employee and project data.
- Allowing managers to efficiently allocate engineers to projects using AI-powered suggestions.
- Giving employees visibility into their project allocations and availability status.
- Enabling proactive insights for upcoming roll-offs and unfilled project needs.
- Ensuring secure access via Google SSO.
