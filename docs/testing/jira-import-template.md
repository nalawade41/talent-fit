## JIRA Configuration for Test Management

### 1. Enable Test Management
1. Install "Zephyr Scale" or "Xray" add-on for JIRA
2. Configure test case custom fields
3. Set up test execution workflows

### 2. Import Process
1. Go to JIRA Test Case management section
2. Use "Import from CSV" functionality
3. Map CSV columns to JIRA fields:
   - Summary → Test Case Name
   - Description → Test Case Description
   - Test Type → Manual
   - Priority → Priority field
   - Status → Approved
   - Component → Component field
   - Labels → Labels field
   - Test Steps → Step-by-step instructions
   - Expected Result → Expected outcomes
   - Preconditions → Prerequisites
   - Test Data → Sample data

### 3. Test Execution Setup
1. Create test cycles for different environments
2. Assign test cases to sprints/releases
3. Configure automated test result integration
4. Set up test execution dashboards

## Test Management Best Practices

### 1. Test Case Organization
- Group by functionality (Data, UI, Integration)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Maintain traceability to requirements

### 2. Execution Planning
- Create test cycles for each release
- Assign test cases to team members
- Track test execution progress

### 3. Reporting and Metrics
- Generate test execution reports
- Track defect trends
- Measure test coverage

### 4. Maintenance
- Review and update test cases regularly
- Remove obsolete test cases
- Add new test cases for new features

## Integration with CI/CD

### Automated Test Execution
1. Configure test execution in CI pipeline
2. Generate test reports automatically
3. Update test management system with results
4. Send notifications on test failures

### Test Result Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm run test:run

- name: Generate Test Report
  run: npm run test:coverage

- name: Update Test Management
  run: # Update JIRA/Azure DevOps with results
```

This template provides a comprehensive framework for importing and managing test cases in enterprise project management systems.
