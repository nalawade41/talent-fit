## 7. Matching & Suggestions
GET `/api/v1/employee/suggestions`

## 8. Notifications

## 9. Status Summary
Implemented (handler has logic or TODO placeholder returning JSON):
- Health, Auth routes, Employee profile (GET/POST/PATCH), Employee allocations (GET), Projects (list/get/create/update), Project allocations (GET/POST/PATCH), Notifications (all), Suggestions (placeholder).

Not Implemented Yet (Declared or planned):
- Project match endpoints, Match explanations, Employee project detail by projectId, Delete project, Data model validation improvements.

---
## 10. Recommended Next Steps
1. Implement auth token issuance (Google ID token -> internal JWT).
2. Add request/response models + validation (e.g., using binding tags in Gin models).
3. Implement filtering logic in `GET /api/v1/employees`.
4. Flesh out match service + endpoints under `/matches`.
5. Add DELETE for projects and soft-delete strategy.
6. Add pagination meta wrapper `{ data, meta }` across list endpoints.
7. Add error normalization middleware.
8. Introduce OpenAPI spec generation (e.g., swaggo/swag) for docs.
