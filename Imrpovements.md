# Talent Fit ‚Äì AI & Feature Enhancement Roadmap (with RAG & Vector DB)

This document outlines potential enhancements for **Talent Fit**, focusing on AI-driven features, proactive notifications, and broader improvements. It also explains how we can leverage **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **vector databases** for more contextual, evolving intelligence.

---

## üöÄ AI Enhancements

### 1. Smarter Project Summarization
- Current: GPT summarization extracts skills, geo, experience, industry.
- Enhancement:
  - Add **industry classification** via fine-tuned model.
  - Restrict skills per **role type** (`backend`, `frontend`, `AI`, `project_manager`).
  - Deduplicate overlapping skills.
  - Normalize **geo to country/region**.
  - Store summaries in **vector DB** ‚Üí searchable later with semantic queries.

---

### 2. AI Scoring & Ranking
- Current: LLM scores candidates (0‚Äì100) with explanations.
- Enhancement:
  - Add **configurable weightage** (skills, geo, exp).
  - Store all **historical project summaries + allocations** as embeddings.
  - At scoring time, use **RAG** to fetch:
    - Similar past projects and their successful matches.
    - Performance/reallocation history of employees.
  - Pass this context into the LLM for richer, experience-based scoring.

---

### 3. Embedding Optimizations
- Current: Employee + project embeddings in pgvector.
- Enhancement:
  - Auto-update embeddings when profiles/projects change.
  - Track **embedding drift** ‚Üí re-generate if stale.
  - Store **allocation outcomes** (success/fail, project closed early, etc.) as documents in vector DB ‚Üí improves future matching.
  - RAG can then answer:
    - ‚ÄúHow were Go + AWS engineers allocated in past fintech projects?‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúWhich profiles worked best for LatAm frontend roles?‚Äù

---

### 4. Bench Prediction
- Current: Detect if employees are free or rolling off in 7 days.
- Enhancement:
  - Use **RAG** to fetch employees with similar historical roll-off patterns.
  - LLM can recommend proactive reallocations:
    - ‚Äú3 engineers rolling off soon match Project X (90%) based on past allocation success.‚Äù

---

### 5. AI Explanations for Managers
- Enhancement:
  - Instead of just rule-based reasoning, use **RAG context**:
    - Similar projects and why certain matches worked/didn‚Äôt.
    - Historical success stories:  
      > ‚ÄúCandidate A is a strong match. Previously allocated to Project Y (Fintech, US), with similar stack (Go, AWS). Delivered successfully over 12 months.‚Äù

---

## üîî Proactive Notifications

### 1. Allocation Notifications
- Current: Email + Slack on allocation.
- Enhancement:
  - Store notifications + outcomes in vector DB.
  - Use RAG to generate **personalized notifications**:
    - Employee: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been allocated to Project X. This project is similar to your previous Project Y where you performed well.‚Äù
    - Manager: ‚ÄúEmployee A previously worked on similar fintech projects and can be a strong mentor for new hires.‚Äù

---

### 2. Bench & Roll-off Alerts
- Current: Employees notified when rolling off.
- Enhancement:
  - RAG can fetch **projects historically staffed by similar roles**.
  - Notify managers with proactive suggestions:
    - ‚Äú2 frontend devs rolling off in LatAm. Historically, similar profiles were successfully reallocated to fintech mobile projects.‚Äù

---

### 3. AI-Generated Recommendations
- Weekly digest for managers:
  - Enhanced with **RAG context**:
    - ‚ÄúLast quarter, backend engineers with Go+AWS skills were reallocated to fintech projects 80% of the time. Employees A & B match this trend.‚Äù

---

## üìä Additional Feature Ideas

### 1. Manager AI Assistant (with RAG)
- Conversational queries backed by vector DB:
  - ‚ÄúShow me candidates similar to those who succeeded in fintech backend projects.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhich employees with React Native experience have historically worked well in US projects?‚Äù

### 2. Employee Career Insights
- Use RAG over past project allocations:
  - Suggest skill development based on **career path patterns**.
  - ‚ÄúEngineers with your profile who added Kubernetes got 30% more matches.‚Äù

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Technical Improvements

- Use **Supabase pgvector** as long-term memory:
  - Store project summaries, allocation outcomes, notification logs.
- RAG pipeline:
  1. Embed project + employee data.
  2. Store in pgvector.
  3. At query/scoring time, retrieve top-K relevant history.
  4. Pass retrieved context into LLM prompt.
- Cost optimization:
  - RAG reduces prompt size (fetch only relevant history).
  - Use cheaper models for summarization, expensive models only when RAG context is added for scoring.

---

# ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **RAG Foundation**
   - Start embedding historical project + employee allocation data.
   - Build retrieval queries (top-K by similarity).

2. **AI Improvements**
   - Enhance scoring with RAG context.
   - Add role-based skill extraction with limits.

3. **Proactive Bench Alerts**
   - Use RAG to match roll-off employees to likely upcoming projects.

4. **Notification Layer**
   - Personalize notifications with historical context from vector DB.

5. **AI Assistant (Phase 2)**
   - Enable natural-language queries powered by RAG + LLM.
